    """Abstract class representing an application destination.

    When a pipeline with an application destination with a matching class name
    and pipeline type is created the implementation class is
    instantiated and passed the pipeline instance and request.

    When the pipeline produces a frame the process_frame method is
    called. It is called once for each frame the pipeline produces.

    When the pipeline has ended the finish method is called to allow
    the destination to dispose of any resources. Finish will be called
    exactly once per pipeline.
