class AppSource(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Abstract class representing an application source.

    When a pipeline with an application source with a matching class
    name and pipeline type is created the implementation class is
    instantiated and passed the pipeline instance and request.

    When the pipeline starts the start_frames method is called to
    signal that it is safe to push frames into the pipeline. Note:
    start frames may be called multiple times.

    When the pipeline can not handle more frames at a point in time
    the pause_frames method will be called. Note: pause frames may be
    called multiple times.

    When the pipeline has ended the finish method is called to allow
    the source to dispose of any resources. Finish will be called
    exactly once per pipeline.
